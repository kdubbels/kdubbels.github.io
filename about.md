The essentials:  
Warrior poet. Likes trains. :train: 

You can check out an (old) web page I made to promote my wares here:  

http://thisis.kristoferdubbels.com/

While it no longer reflects my current interests exactly (or the current state of my programming and design skills!), it is a good time capsule of where I was in late 2014/ early 2015. I'm still quite proud of it. At the time I made it, I was completely self-taught. Now I have awesome co-workers and others to help me along.

You can see some code I've written here:

I am slowly trying to go through and write READMEs for everything. The majority of my repos are either snippets I'm saving for reference or the end-products of various tutorials I've worked my way through. A handful of projects, however, will hopefully become mature little applications at some point.
