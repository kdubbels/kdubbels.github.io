Comradely greetings,

My name is Kristofer Dubbels and I am running for the position of Chair. 

I joined DSA because it is the only socialist group with the confidence and vision to actually win. No other socialist group possesses DSA's unique combination of commitment to results-oriented action, lively internal culture of education and debate, willingness to work inside and outside of existing political structures, and openness to newcomers.

My vision for DSA in Denver is to continue to grow the organization as a social power independent of any political party, while continuing our engagement with electoral politics. For example, I'd like to continue to orient Denver DSA towards active labor solidarity (for example, DSA was the only socialist organization in Denver to join striking CWA workers last month). I will also continue to distinguish DSA as the friendliest socialist organization in Denver, a place where folks entirely new to radical politics can feel welcome. 

I will continue our friendly relationships with established socialist groups in Denver, but I also plan to continue building up our relationships with newer Denver progressive organizations such as the Working Families Party and Our Revolution. Recruiting dissatisfied liberals and radicalizing them is our most surefire route to organizational growth in the immediate future (turning “passive allies” into “active allies”).  Building this capacity allows us to have a larger presence and visibility at picket lines, rallies, and community events; this in turn allows us to reach a bigger, broader audience. If we do our jobs well and recruit enough of new folks, we’ll finally be able to destroy capitalism and save the world.

I will bring a number of skills and qualifications to this position. In November 2016, I initiated the original organizing of this chapter, and I've conducted communications with the National Office since.  I've reserved spaces for chapter meetings, social gatherings, and reading group meetings. I carried out the devolution process that allowed Denver to form its own chapter independent of the existing Boulder DSA. I attended all the planning meetings of the May Day coalition. I initiated our organizational contact with the Colorado Working Families Party. I am a member of the Electoral Committee, the Racial Justice Committee, and I participate in our chapter's Reading Group. I organized DSA's picket line presence at the recent AT&T strike.

Denver voted overwhelmingly for Bernie Sanders in 2016 and yet all the socialist organizations in town are exceptionally small. There is clearly an appetite for a more radical approach to politics that other socialist groups have failed to engage with. Other socialist groups in Denver have failed to grow because they have alienated potential allies through elitism, hostility to newcomers, and general unwillingness to meet people where they are. I believe that DSA can fill this niche and that I am the most qualified person to make it happen. Thank you.

In solidarity,

Kristofer Dubbels
