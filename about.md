# Schools I went to, and some degrees I was granted

I earned an MA in Sociology from the New School for Social Research in 2013. Here I am on [their list of 2013 placements](http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/sociology-recent-placements/), a lone web developer in a sea of doctoral students. My studies focused on social theory, the history of sociology, historical sociology, and historiography (which are all distinct things with very similar names).

Prior to that, I earned a BA in philosophy in 2011 from the University of Minnesota Duluth. For some reason, the vaunted daily newspaper the Fargo _Forum_ [published a mention of me making Dean's List in Fall of 2010](http://www.inforum.com/content/namedroppers-february-13-2011).

# Some things I've been paid to do

I worked as a research associate at the [Information Policy and Access Center](http://ipac.umd.edu/) from 2013 to 2015. I worked on [this survey](http://digitalinclusion.umd.edu/sites/default/files/uploads/2013DigInclusion_StateReport.pdf) and published [this review of Aram Sinnreich's _The Piracy Crusade: How the Music Industry's War on Sharing Destroys Markets and Erodes Civil Liberties_ in the journal _Library Quarterly_](https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.1086/681619?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents).

I also was acknowledged in the acknowledgements to [these](https://books.google.com/books?id=VtFiAwAAQBAJ&pg=PR15&lpg=PR15&dq=Kristofer+dubbels&source=bl&ots=oqr6fR5BN4&sig=6KJCP9C1uqbUkRffSsIGxihrBOc&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWrc-w1M7VAhUi64MKHQiCBNs4ChDoAQgvMAI#v=onepage&q=Kristofer%20dubbels&f=false) [books](https://books.google.com/books?id=JaJjBAAAQBAJ&pg=PR7&lpg=PR7&dq=Kristofer+dubbels&source=bl&ots=QwEHfyhk07&sig=Y2ul6EKA_US3T1YiDk2alTybNxM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiWrc-w1M7VAhUi64MKHQiCBNs4ChDoAQg2MAQ#v=onepage&q=Kristofer%20dubbels&f=false), neither of which I worked on directly. ¬Ø\\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø

After leaving the Information Policy and Access Center, I began working as a professional web developer. My web devlepment work has focused on using JavaScript - and D3 in particular - to create interactive data visualizations.

I have also built custom content management systems with Rails and Django (I prefer Ruby as a language and Django as a framework). I also have dabbled in Scheme, Clojure, Haskell, Elixir, and constantly try to apply functional precepts and techniques to the way I write both JavaScript and Ruby.

# Programming Stuff I Know

* JavaScript
  * My strongest language and the one I've programmed in most extensively.
* TypeScript
  * I grew up in an era when anything Microsoft-related was gauche, but TS is üëç
* CSS
  * Well, I guess we are stuck with it now.
* HTML
  * Gotta structure those documents with something.
* Ruby
  * My second strongest language. I've primarily used it through Rails.

* Vim
  * Idk, it seems to work.
* Git
  * Pretty neat to have a comprehensive history of all your mistakes üòé
