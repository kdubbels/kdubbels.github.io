Chapter 1. The Problem

Let's say, for the sake of argument, we decided wanted to _plan_ our economy, rather than rely on the whims of the market place to allocate goods.

Naturally, we will want to start out by writing up a list of everything we need in our economy.

For now, let's assume we have a very simple economy - since we are nooblers at economic planning, we'll start out by producing only two products: iron and wheat. (This may sound a bit _too_ simplistic; rest assured, things get messy quite quickly.)

Now, even with our two-product economy, we still need to take account of _labor_, which is a rather unique "product". The crucial thing to realize before we start planning is that all three products interrelate: they relate to each other in the form of "inputs" and "outputs". Simply put, it will take inputs of labor to produce corn. Let's say it takes 100 "units"* of labor to produce 50 units of corn. So we say that 50 units of corn requires 100 units of labor.

Now, let's also assume that corn requires some machines in order to be planted and harvested; a unit of corn requires inputs of iron. Let's say it takes 5 units of iron to produce 50 units of corn. 

So far so good - but in order to keep growing corn year after year, we'll also have to use inputs of corn in order to get back outputs of corn. _And_ we'll need to use inputs of corn to get outputs of labor (your workers will need to eat, after all). And, importantly, those units of labor will of course in turn serve as inputs into the next crop of corn.

We can already start to see why a three sector economy is already fairly complex, particularly if we want to have enough outputs for the system to reproduce itself year after year. We can already see, however, that a simple list of products we'd like to consume won't suffice; we'll also need to take account of a surplus if we want our economy to reproduce itself past one "round" of production.

How would we go about creating a "list" that allows us to account for this intricate system of inputs and outputs? Luckily, we don't have to start conceptualizing the input-output relationship from scratch; matrix algebra provides a readymade toolkit for describing these relationships.

Chapter 2. Enter the Matrix

So - what is a matrix?


 *In order for the products in our economy to be commensurable, we have to use some generic type of measurement; we'll use the term "unit" rather than any specific unit of measurement for simplicity's sake.
