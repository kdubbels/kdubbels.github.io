"The essence of functional programming is that programs are a combination of expressions. Expressions include concrete values, variables, and also functions. Functions have a more specific definition: they are expressions that are applied to an argument or input, and once applied, can be reduced or evaluated." Haskell book, p2-3

"A function is a relation be- tween a set of possible inputs and a set of possible outputs. The function itself defines and represents the relationship. When you apply a function such as addition to two inputs, it maps those two inputs to an output — the sum of those numbers." p4

"What matters here is that the relationship of inputs and outputs is defined by the function, and that the output is pre- dictable when you know the input and the function definition. ... Understanding functions in this way — as a mapping of a set of inputs to a set of outputs — is crucial to understanding functional programming." p6

"The lambda calculus has three basic components, or lambda terms: expressions, variables, and abstractions. The word ex- pression refers to a superset of all those things: an expression can be a variable name, an abstraction, or a combination of those things. The simplest expression is a single variable. Vari- ables here have no meaning or value; they are only names for potential inputs to functions.
An abstraction is a function. It is a lambda term that has a head (a lambda) and a body and is applied to an argument. An argument is an input value." p7
