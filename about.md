The essentials:  

Warrior poet. Likes trains. :train: 

Other stuff:  

You can check out an (old) web page I made to promote my wares here:

While it no longer reflects my current interests exactly (or the current state of my programming and design skills!), it is a good time capsule of where I was in late 2014/ early 2015. I'm still quite proud of it. At the time I made it, I was completely self-taught. Now I have awesome co-workers and others to help me along.

You can see some code I've written here:

I am slowly trying to go through and write READMEs for everything. The majority of my repos are either snippets I'm saving for reference or the end-products of various tutorials I've worked my way through. A handful of projects, however, will hopefully become mature little applications at some point.

Here is a single-page app I built for a developer job in January 2015: https://github.com/kdubbels/phone-book (https://github.com/kdubbels/phone-book)

It doesn't actually work, but I moved it from a private BitBucket repo as a reminder to myself how much progress I've made in calendar year 2015, and to keep myself reasonably humble. My HTML, PHP, and CSS skills were actually pretty good at the time, all told, but I had only worked with Drupal and single-page static sites at that point. I didn't yet totally grok HTTP or the DOM (I pride myself on vanilla JS DOM traversal, but I still only know a tiny fraction of all I'd like to know about networking). Enjoy. (Sneer if you must.)
