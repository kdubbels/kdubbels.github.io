Hey true believers.

The big thing I really want to get working by the end of November is a relatively humble single-page app I am currently calling "library-spa". (I'm sure a better name will come to me in production.) It is partly practical - as a way for me to keep track of my reading, and partly an excuse to learn Sinatra and Angular. My plan is to keep track of my reading with a Postgres/ Sinatra back-end and an Angular/ D3 front-end, which will be a dashboard that breaks down the books I've read by genre, year, etc. Maybe it will interact with some external API at some juncture. So far, I haven't been able to get much work in on it. I've been trying to really utilize unit tests as I go along, namely Rspec and Jasmine, but so far I've been held up by issues getting it to work in production on Heroku. (Compounded by the fact that my ISP seems to not like me connecting to Heroku.)

My other project is a relatively straighforward CMS I'm building in Rails. Why do I need a CMS when I already have this nifty little Jekyll site you are looking at right now? The CMS is mostly intended to house my more, uh, literary endeavors or whatever. I halted front-end work on my Drupal-based site [www.kristoferdubbels.com](http://www.kristoferdubbels.com), and also stopped writing. Nearly all my free-time on the computer is spent programming or reading about programming or watching videos of Douglas Crockford talk about programming. I'm hoping autumn 2015 and winter 2016 will see me return to leisure reading/ writing, but I want to have a decent looking/ behaving website to house it all on first. And Ruby is fun!

Peace. Feels good. :feelsgood:
