    <code><span class="zhighlight-underline zhighlight-underline--center">I haven't touched this site</span><span class="zhighlight-underline zhighlight-underline--center"> very much in the last 3 years,</span> I am currently working on writing and desigining a new version in Gatbsy (this was originally written in Jekyll and includes some pretty geriatric React. The new version will have a <span class="zhighlight-underline zhighlight-underline--center">more intentional design</span> and will utilize all the fun <span class="zhighlight-underline zhighlight-underline--center">accessibility</span> stuff I learned at my day job in the last year.</code>
